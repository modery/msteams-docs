# Create deep links

Deep links are a navigation mechanism that you can use to connect users with information and features within Teams and Teams apps. Some scenarios where creating deep links can be useful are as follows:

* Navigating the user to the content within one of your app's tabs. For instance, your app can have a bot that sends messages notifying the user of an important activity. When the user taps on the notification, the deep link navigates to the tab so that the user can view more details about the activity.
* Your app automates or simplifies certain user tasks, such as creating a chat or scheduling a meeting, by pre-populating the deep links with required parameters. This avoids the need for users to manually enter information.

The Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK (TeamsJS) simplifies the process of navigation. For many scenarios, such as navigating to content and information within your tab or even launching a chat dialog, the SDK provides strongly typed APIs that make for an improved experience and can replace the usage of deep links. These APIs are recommended for Teams apps that might be run in other hosts (Outlook, Office), as they also provide a way to check that the capability being used is supported by that host. The following sections show information about deep linking, but also highlight how scenarios that used to require it have changed with the v2 release of TeamsJS.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>
> The behavior of deep links is dependent on a number of factors. The following list outlines the behavior of deep links on Teams entities.
>
> **Tab**:  
> ✔ Directly navigates to the deep link url.
>
> **Bot**:  
> ✔ Deep link in card body: Opens in browser first.  
> ✔ Deep link added to OpenURL action in Adaptive Card: Directly navigates to the deep link url.  
> ✔ Hyperlink markdown text in the card: Opens in browser first.  
>
> **Chat**:  
> ✔ Text message hyperlink markdown: Directly navigates to deep link url.  
> ✔ Link pasted in general chat conversation: Directly navigates to deep link url.
>
>
>The navigation behavior of a Teams app extended across Microsoft 365 (Outlook/Office) is dependent on two factors:
>
> * The target that the deep link points to
> * The host where the Teams app is running
>
> If the Teams app is running within the host where the deep link is targeted, your app will open directly within the host. However, if the Teams app is running in a different host from where the deep link is targeted, the app will first open in the browser.

## Deep link to your tab

You can create deep links to entities in Teams apps. This method is used to create links that navigate to content and information within your tab. For example, if your tab contains a task list, team members can create and share links to individual tasks. When you select the link, it navigates to your tab that focuses on the specific item.

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

To implement this, add a **copy link** action to each item, in whatever way best suits your UI. When the user takes this action, call [pages.shareDeepLink()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-sharedeeplink&preserve-view=true) to display a dialog box containing a link that the user can copy to the clipboard. When you make this call, pass an ID for your item, which you get back in the [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) when the link is followed and your tab is reloaded.

```javascript
pages.shareDeepLink({ subPageId: <subPageId>, subPageLabel: <subPageLabel>, subPageWebUrl: <subPageWebUrl> })
```

You will need to replace the fields with the appropriate information:

* `subPageId`: A unique identifier for the item within your page to which you're deep linking.
* `subPageLabel`: A label for the item to use for displaying the deep link.
* `subPageWebUrl`: A fallback URL to use if the client can't render the page.

For more information see, [pages.shareDeepLink()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-sharedeeplink&preserve-view=true).

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

To implement this, you add a **copy link** action to each item, in whatever way best suits your UI. When the user takes this action, you call `shareDeepLink()` to display a dialog box containing a link that the user can copy to the clipboard. When you make this call, you also pass an ID for your item, which you get back in the [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) when the link is followed and your tab is reloaded.

```javascript
microsoftTeams.shareDeepLink({ subEntityId: <subEntityId>, subEntityLabel: <subEntityLabel>, subEntityWebUrl: <subEntityWebUrl> })
```

You will need to replace the fields with the appropriate information:

* `subEntityId`: A unique identifier for the item within your tab to which you're deep linking.
* `subEntityLabel`: A label for the item to use for displaying the deep link.
* `subEntityWebUrl`: An optional field with a fallback URL to use if the client doesn't support rendering the tab.

---

Alternatively, you can also generate deep links programmatically, using the format specified later in this article. You can use deep links in [bot](~/bots/what-are-bots.md) and [connector](~/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md) messages that inform users about changes to your tab, or to items within it.

> [!NOTE]
> This deep link is different from the links provided by the **Copy link to tab** menu item, which just generates a deep link that points to this tab.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, shareDeepLink does not work on mobile platforms.

### Consume a deep link from a tab

When navigating to a deep link, Microsoft Teams simply navigates to the tab and provides a mechanism through the Microsoft Teams JavaScript library to retrieve the sub-page ID if it exists.

The [`app.getContext()`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-app-getcontext&preserve-view=true) call (`microsoftTeams.getContext()`) in TeamsJS v1) returns a promise that will resolve with the context that includes the `subPageId` property (subEntityId for TeamsJS v1) if the tab is navigated through a deep link. For more information see [PageInfo interface](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-app-pageinfo&preserve-view=true).

### Generate a deep link to your tab

While it is recommended to use `shareDeepLink()` to generate a deep link to your tab, it is possible to manually create one too.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Personal tabs have a `personal` scope, while channel and group tabs use `team` or `group` scopes. The two tab types have a slightly different syntax since only the configurable tab has a `channel` property associated with its context object. See the [manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md) reference for more information on tab scopes.
> * Deep links work properly only if the tab was configured using the v0.4 or later library and because of that has an entity ID. Deep links to tabs without entity IDs still navigate to the tab but cannot provide the sub entity ID to the tab.

Use the following format for a deep link that you can use in a bot, connector, or message extension card:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<appId>/<entityId>?webUrl=<entityWebUrl>&label=<entityLabel>&context=<context>`

> [!NOTE]
> If the bot sends a message containing a `TextBlock` with a deep link, then a new browser tab is opened when the user selects the link. This happens in Chrome and in the Microsoft Teams desktop app, both running on Linux.
> If the bot sends the same deep link URL into an `Action.OpenUrl`, then the Teams tab is opened in the current browser tab when the user selects the link. A new browser tab isn't opened.

<!--- TBD: Edit this article.
* Admonitions/alerts seem to be overused. 
* An important alert at the end of this table does not make sense. Also, it has a code snippet inside it.
* List items in the table are not formatted well in output.
* Some headings use -ing verbs.
* Example values and some URLs should be in backticks and not emphasized.
* Codeblock are missing language.
* Check for markdownlint errors.
* Table with just a row isn't really needed. Provide the content without tabulating it.

## Navigation from your tab

You can navigate to content in Teams from your tab using TeamsJS or deep links. This is useful if your tab needs to connect users with other content in Teams, such as to a channel, message, another tab or even to open a scheduling dialog. Formerly, navigation might have required a deep link, but it can now in many instances be accomplished using the SDK. The following sections show both methods, but where possible use of the strongly typed capabilities of the SDK is recommended.

One of the benefits of using TeamsJS, particularly for Teams apps that might run in other hosts (Outlook and Office), is that it's possible to check that the host supports the capability you're attempting to use. To check a host's support of a capability, you can use the `isSupported()` function associated with the namespace of the API. The TeamsJS SDK organizes APIs into capabilities by way of namespaces. For example, prior to usage of an API in the `pages` namespace you can check the returned boolean value from `pages.isSupported()` and take the appropriate action within the context of your app and apps UI.  

For additional information about capabilities and the APIs in TeamsJS, see [Building tabs and other hosted experiences with the Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](~/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md#apis-organized-into-capabilities).

### Navigate within your app

It is possible to navigate within an app using TeamsJS. The following code demonstrates how to navigate to a specific entity within your Teams app.

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

You can trigger a navigation from your tab using the [pages.navigateToApp()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-navigatetoapp&preserve-view=true) function as shown in the following code:

```javascript
if (pages.isSupported()) {
  const navPromise = pages.navigateToApp({ appId: <appId>, pageId: <pageId>, webUrl: <webUrl>, subPageId: <subPageId>, channelId:<channelId>});
  navPromise.
     then((result) => {/*Successful navigation*/}).
     catch((error) => {/*Failed navigation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

For more information about using the pages capability, see [pages.navigateToApp()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-navigatetoapp&preserve-view=true) and the [pages](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) namespace for other navigation options. If needed, it is also possible to directly open a deep link using the [app.openLink()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-app-openlink&preserve-view=true) function.

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

To trigger a deep link from your tab, call:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.executeDeepLink(/*deepLink*/);
```

---

### Open a scheduling dialog

You can open a scheduling dialog from your Teams app, as shown in the following code. This is especially useful if your app helps the user complete calendar or scheduling related tasks.

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

```javascript
// Open a scheduling dialog from your tab
if(calendar.isSupported()) {
   const calendarPromise = calendar.composeMeeting({
      attendees: ["joe@contoso.com", "bob@contoso.com"],
      content: "test content",
      endTime: "2018-10-24T10:30:00-07:00"
      startTime: "2018-10-24T10:00:00-07:00"
      subject: "test subject"});
   calendarPromise.
      then((result) => {/*Successful operation*/}).
      catch((error) => {/*Unsuccessful operation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

For more information about working with the calendar see, the [calendar](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/calendar?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) namespace in the API reference documentation.

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

```javascript
// Open a scheduling dialog from your tab
microsoftTeams.executeDeepLink("https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/new?subject=test%20subject&attendees=joe@contoso.com,bob@contoso.com&startTime=10%2F24%2F2018%2010%3A30%3A00&endTime=10%2F24%2F2018%2010%3A30%3A00&content=​​​​​​​test%3Acontent​​​​​​​​​​​​​​");
```

---

#### Generate a deep link to the scheduling dialog

While it's recommended to use the strongly typed APIs of TeamsJS, it is possible to manually create deep links to the Teams built-in scheduling dialog. Use the following format for a deep link that you can use in a bot, Connector, or message extension card:
`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/new?subject=<meeting subject>&startTime=<date>&endTime=<date>&content=<content>&attendees=<user1>,<user2>,<user3>,...`

Example: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/new?subject=test%20subject&attendees=joe@contoso.com,bob@contoso.com&startTime=10%2F24%2F2018%2010%3A30%3A00&endTime=10%2F24%2F2018%2010%3A30%3A00&content=​​​​​​​test%3Acontent​​​​​​​​​​​​​​`

> [!NOTE]
> The search parameters don't support `+` signal in place of whitespace (` `). Ensure your uri encoding code returns `%20` for spaces for example, `?subject=test%20subject` is good, but `?subject=test+subject` is bad.

The query parameters are:

* `attendees`: The optional comma-separated list of user IDs representing the attendees of the meeting. The user performing the action is the meeting organizer. Currently, the User ID field supports only the Azure AD UserPrincipalName, typically an email address.
* `startTime`: The optional start time of the event. This should be in [long ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), for example *2018-03-12T23:55:25+02:00*.
* `endTime`: The optional end time of the event, also in ISO 8601 format.
* `subject`: An optional field for the meeting subject.
* `content`: An optional field for the meeting details field.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, specifying the location isn't supported. You must specify the UTC offset, it means time zones when generating your start and end times.

To use this deep link with your bot, you can specify this as the URL target in your card's button or tap action through the `openUrl` action type.

### Open an app install dialog

You can open an app install dialog from your Teams app, as shown in the following code.

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

```javascript
// Open an app install dialog from your tab
if(appInstallDialog.isSupported()) {
    const dialogPromise = appInstallDialog.openAppInstallDialog({ appID: <appId>});
    dialogPromise.
      then((result) => {/*Successful operation*/}).
      catch((error) => {/*Unsuccessful operation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

For more information about the install dialog see the [appInstallDialog.openAppInstallDialog()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/appinstalldialog?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-appinstalldialog-openappinstalldialog&preserve-view=true) function in the API reference documentation.

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

```javascript
// Open an app install dialog from your tab
microsoftTeams.executeDeepLink("https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/f46ad259-0fe5-4f12-872d-c737b174bcb4");
```

---

### Navigate to a chat

You can navigate to or create private chats between users with TeamsJS by specifying the set of participants. If a chat doesn’t exist with the specified participants, the user is navigated to an empty new chat. New chats are created in draft state until the user sends the first message. Otherwise, you can specify the name of the chat if it doesn’t already exist, along with text that should be inserted into the user's compose box. You can think of this feature as a shortcut for the user taking the manual action of navigating to or creating the chat, and then typing out the message.

As an example use case, if you’re returning an Office 365 user profile from your bot as a card, this deep link can allow the user to easily chat with that person. The following example demonstrates how to open a chat message to a group of participants with an initial message.

```javascript
if(chat.isSupported()) {
    const chatPromise = chat.openGroupChat({ users: ["joe@contoso.com","bob@contoso.com"], topic: "Prep For Meeting Tomorrow", message: "Hi folks kicking off chat about our meeting tomorrow"});
    chatPromise.
      then((result) => {/*Successful operation*/}).
      catch((error) => {/*Unsuccessful operation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

While use of the strongly typed APIs is recommended, you can alternatively use the following format for a manually created deep link that you can use in a bot, connector, or message extension card:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=<user1>,<user2>,...&topicName=<chat name>&message=<precanned text>`

Example: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=joe@contoso.com,bob@contoso.com&topicName=Prep%20For%20Meeting%20Tomorrow&message=Hi%20folks%2C%20kicking%20off%20a%20chat%20about%20our%20meeting%20tomorrow`

The query parameters are:

* `users`: The comma-separated list of user IDs representing the participants of the chat. The user that performs the action is always included as a participant. Currently, the User ID field supports the Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) UserPrincipalName, such as an email address only.
* `topicName`: An optional field for chat's display name, in the case of a chat with three or more users. If this field isn't specified, the chat's display name is based on the names of the participants.
* `message`: An optional field for the message text that you want to insert into the current user's compose box while the chat is in a draft state.

To use this deep link with your bot, specify this as the URL target in your card's button or tap action through the `openUrl` action type.

### Generate deep links to channel conversation

Use this deep link format to navigate to a particular conversation within channel thread:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/<channelId>/<parentMessageId>?tenantId=<tenantId>&groupId=<groupId>&parentMessageId=<parentMessageId>&teamName=<teamName>&channelName=<channelName>&createdTime=<createdTime>`

Example: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/<channelId>/1648741500652?tenantId=<tenantId>&groupId=<groupId>&parentMessageId=1648741500652&teamName=<teamName>&channelName=<channelName>&createdTime=1648741500652`

The query parameters are:

* `channelId`: Channel ID of the conversation. For example `19:3997a8734ee5432bb9cdedb7c432ae7d@thread.tacv2`.
* `tenantId`: Tenant ID such as `0d9b645f-597b-41f0-a2a3-ef103fbd91bb`.
* `groupId`: Group ID of the file. For example `3606f714-ec2e-41b3-9ad1-6afb331bd35d`.
* `parentMessageId`: Parent message Id of the conversation.
* `teamName`: Name of the team.
* `channelName`: Name of the team's channel.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see `channelId` and `groupId` in the URL from the channel.

### Generate deep links to file in channel

The following deep link format can be used in a bot, connector, or message extension card:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/<fileId>?tenantId=<tenantId>&fileType=<fileType>&objectURL=<objectURL>&baseUrl=<baseURL>&serviceName=<Name>&threadId=<threadId>&groupId=<groupId>`

The query parameters are:

* `fileId`: Unique file ID from SharePoint Online, also known as `sourcedoc`. For example,`1FA202A5-3762-4F10-B550-C04F81F6ACBD`.
* `tenantId`: Tenant ID such as `0d9b645f-597b-41f0-a2a3-ef103fbd91bb`.
* `fileType`: Supported file type, such as .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, and .pdf.
* `objectUrl`: Object URL of the file. The format is `https://{tenantName}.sharepoint.com/sites/{TeamName}/SharedDocuments/{ChannelName}/FileName.ext`. For example, `https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/(filepath)`.
* `baseUrl`: Base URL of the file. The format is `https://{tenantName}.sharepoint.com/sites/{TeamName}`. For example, `https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams`.
* `serviceName`: Name of the service, app ID. For example, `teams`.
* `threadId`: The threadId is the team ID of the team where the file is stored. It is optional and cannot be set for files stored in a user's OneDrive folder. threadId - 19:f8fbfc4d89e24ef5b3b8692538cebeb7@thread.skype.
* `groupId`: Group ID of the file. For example `ae063b79-5315-4ddb-ba70-27328ba6c31e`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see `threadId` and `groupId` in the URL from the channel.  

The following deep link format is used in a bot, connector, or message extension card:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/<fileId>?tenantId=<tenantId>&fileType=<fileType>&objectURL=<objectURL>&baseUrl=<baseURL>&serviceName=<Name>&threadId=<threadId>&groupId=<groupId>`

The following example format illustrates the deep link to files:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/5E0154FC-F2B4-4DA5-8CDA-F096E72C0A80?tenantId=0d9b645f-597b-41f0-a2a3-ef103fbd91bb&fileType=pptx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FActionPlatform%2FShared%20Documents%2FFC7-%20Bot%20and%20Action%20Infra%2FKaizala%20Actions%20in%20Adaptive%20Cards%20-%20Deck.pptx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FActionPlatform&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:f8fbfc4d89e24ef5b3b8692538cebeb7@thread.skype&groupId=ae063b79-5315-4ddb-ba70-27328ba6c31e`

```

### Deep linking to an app

Create a deep link for the app after the app is listed in the Teams store. To create a link to launch Teams, append the app ID to the following URL: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/<your-app-id>`. A dialog box appears to install the app.
  
### Deep linking for SharePoint Framework tabs

The following deep link format can be used in a bot, connector or message extension card:
`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<AppId>/<EntityId>?webUrl=<entityWebUrl>/<EntityName>`

> [!NOTE]
> When a bot sends a TextBlock message with a deep link, a new browser tab opens when users select the link. This happens in Chrome and Microsoft Teams desktop app running on Linux.
> If the bot sends the same deep link URL into an `Action.OpenUrl`, the Teams tab opens in the current browser when the user selects the link. No new browser tab is opened.

The query parameters are:

* `appID`: Your manifest ID, for example `fe4a8eba-2a31-4737-8e33-e5fae6fee194`.

* `entityID`: The item ID that you provided when [configuring the tab](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md). For example, `tasklist123`.
* `entityWebUrl`: An optional field with a fallback URL to use if the client doesn't support rendering of the tab - `https://tasklist.example.com/123` or `https://tasklist.example.com/list123/task456`.
* `entityName`: A label for the item in your tab, to use when displaying the deep link, Task List 123 or Task 456.

Example: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fe4a8eba-2a31-4737-8e33-e5fae6fee194/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123&TaskList`

### Navigate to an audio or audio-video call

You can invoke audio only or audio-video calls to a single user or a group of users, by specifying the call type and the participants. Before placing the call, Teams client prompts a confirmation to make the call. In case of group call, you can call a set of VoIP users and a set of PSTN users in the same deep link invocation.

In case of a video call, the client will ask for confirmation and turn on the caller's video for the call. The receiver of the call has a choice to respond through audio only or audio and video, through the Teams call notification window.

> [!NOTE]
> This method cannot be used for invoking a meeting.

The following code demonstrates using the TeamsJS SDK to start a call:

```javascript
if(call.isSupported()) {
    const callPromise = call.startCall({ targets: ["joe@contoso.com","bob@contoso.com","4:9876543210"], requestedModalities: [call.CallModalities.Audio], source: "demoApp"});
    callPromise.
      then((result) => {/*Successful operation*/}).
      catch((error) => {/*Unsuccessful operation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }

```

#### Generate a deep link to a call

While use of the strongly typed APIs of TeamsJS is recommended, you can also use a manually created deep link to start a call.

| Deep link | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Make an audio call | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=<user1>,<user2>` | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=joe@contoso.com` |
| Make an audio and video call | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=<user1>,<user2>&withVideo=true` | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=joe@contoso.com&withVideo=true` |
|Make an audio and video call with an optional parameter source | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=<user1>,<user2>&withVideo=true&source=demoApp` | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=joe@contoso.com&withVideo=true&source=demoApp` |  
| Make an audio and video call to a combination of VoIP and PSTN users | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=<user1>,4:<phonenumber>` | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/call/0/0?users=joe@contoso.com,4:9876543210` |
  
Following are the query parameters:

* `users`: The comma-separated list of user IDs representing the participants of the call. Currently, the User ID field supports the Azure AD UserPrincipalName, typically an email address, or in case of a PSTN call, it supports a pstn mri 4:&lt;phonenumber&gt;.
* `withVideo`: This is an optional parameter, which you can use to make a video call. Setting this parameter will only turn on the caller's camera. The receiver of the call has a choice to answer through audio or audio and video call through the Teams call notification window.
* `Source`: This is an optional parameter, which informs about the source of the deep link.
